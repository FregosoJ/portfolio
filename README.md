Jonathan First Portfolio

As my first Portfolio this is to show the  beggining stages of my jurney in becoming a codder. 
Looking at my first work Horseon-Refactor witch is a link to my GitHub account on my first project for UCLA bootcamp.
This first project has shown me how coding works, how to interact with it and manipulated. This project is the start to a lot of challenges witch include how to code, how to de-bug, and how to write your own code. 
By using VS code, and the inspect tool on the website we can write, debug, and insure that we meet the perameters that the client has put infant of us.
